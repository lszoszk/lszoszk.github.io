    abstract={This paper analyses five constitutional developments in Central and Eastern Europe that can impact the domestic implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Using Czechia, Poland and Slovenia as examples, the paper highlights four potential drivers, namely: (1) the process of constitutionalizing human rights; (2) the proliferation of the doctrine of horizontal effect of constitutional rights; (3) the constitutional legitimacy of state intervention in the free market economy; and (4) the mechanism of judicial review. Furthermore, the author underlines the most significant challenge, which is increasing resistance to international norms in some countries, e.g., Poland. The paper concludes that the jurisprudence of the constitutional courts can facilitate the domestic implementation of the UNGPs, particularly Pillars I (State duty to protect human rights) and III (access to remedy).},

    abstract={In March 2022, the European Commission presented its long-awaited legislative proposal on the EU-wide human rights and environmental due diligence (HREDD) for business. This article argues that the proposed Directive fails to be an effective and innovative legislation in three respects. Firstly, it does not draw lessons from the shortcomings of the to-date regulatory policy relating to business and human rights. It mainly consolidates at the EU level the status quo of extant due diligence legislation in Europe. Secondly, the proposal falls short of the established interna­tional standards and its own objectives insofar as it fails to establish instruments for effectively preventing and remedying human rights and environmental harm. Thirdly, the proposal’s normative preference for process- (rather than result-) oriented HREDD risks reducing it to yet another compliance instrument. Beside amending these shortcomings, to achieve a breakthrough, the upcoming legislation should in any case define HREDD as the legal standard of care; the compliance with which does not per se exclude civil liability. The general negotiation approach of the Council is not proposing much improvement in that regard. The stakes for the European Parliament’s possible role to raise the bar are thus very high.},

    abstract={The book discusses the challenges of regulating the development of Artificial Intelligence from a human rights perspective. The analysis begins by acknowledging that scientific and technical progress is leading to the emergence of a new scientific paradigm based on data mining (Big Data paradigm). Therefore, ensuring equal access to data becomes crucial to guarantee equal enjoyment of the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. The main objective is to define the State's obligations derived from the rights in the field of science, i.e., Article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), with regard to data availability and accessibility. It further discusses challenges related to the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression, and the right to protect the interests of creators. The analysis of regulations at the universal (UN), regional (primarily EU), and national (Polish Constitution and legislation) levels precedes the interpretation of State obligations. The author presents their own interpretation of the criteria for fulfilling obligations regarding data availability and accessibility.}

    abstract={At least 330,000 children are deprived of their liberty for migration related reasons every year worldwide. Because of the limited data available publicly, little is known about the characteristics of these children. This study aims to verify the existence, accessibility, and quality of data on immigration detention of children. In order to verify what categories of data are recorded by the public authorities, the authors approached 37 states requesting statistics under Freedom of Information regulations. Migration authorities were asked for historical and up-to-date statistics disaggregated by basic demographic features such as gender, nationality and accompanied status. Although the findings confirm the scarcity of data, several data-related promising practices were identified. Their implementation can significantly improve data capabilities of migration authorities and contribute to better policy making, particularly in measuring the progress toward ending the immigration detention of children. This report builds on the experience of the UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty (2019) which was the first scientific attempt to assess the magnitude of the situation of children deprived of liberty, including migrant children.},

    abstract={The aim of this study is to analyze the role that the Internet plays in the enjoyment of human rights and answer the question of whether we may be in the process of recognizing a new right, namely the right to Internet access. The conclusions are built upon a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the Internet-related recommendations adopted by the UN treaty-based bodies in the period between 2007 and 2017. Moreover, the paper is supplemented by a brief overview of the relevant recommendations formulated under the mechanism of the Universal Periodic Review. Analysis of the content of recommendations allowed them to be classified into two groups – the first one integrates recommendations that refer to the duty of non-interference, and the second concerns the duty to expand Internet infrastructure across the country. The article ends with a call for further investigation of the normative potential of Article 15(1)b of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as this hitherto forgotten provision might shed a new light on the proposed right to Internet access.},

    author={Szoszkiewicz, Ł.},
    abstract={Linguistic human rights are a concept remaining on the crossroads of several scientific disciplines, e.g. linguistics, anthropology, psychology and, last but not least, human rights law. Taking the latter as a lens, this study seeks to clarify the concept of linguistic human rights in education – presumably, the most linguistically sensitive sphere in the life of individuals and communities. The paper demonstrates that despite little mention of language in the UN treaties (ICESCR, CRC, CERD, CADE), its importance is reflected in the practice of the relevant treaty-based bodies. Moreover, increasing interest from scholars across a range of disciplines is contributing to the development of a linguistic human rights doctrine and is penetrating the UN human rights framework.},

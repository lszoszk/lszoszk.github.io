<p>Building on the experience from the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/treaty-bodies/crc/united-nations-global-study-children-deprived-liberty">UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty</a> and its follow-up initiatives, this project aims to provide a better understanding of the concept of promising/good/best practices in international human rights law, with particular focus on children’s rights. To this end, the project foresees:
<ul>
<li>Conducting ca. <strong>20 interviews with human rights experts</strong> with expertise in children’s rights.</li>
<li>Development of the <strong>blueprint criteria for identifying promising practices</strong> in the area of huamn rights.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> these criteria on the sample of ca. 20 cases, which will be further integrated into the <a href="https://nochildbehindbars.com/map/">interactive database of promising practices</a> under the Globl Study on Children Deprived of Liberty.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project’s main outputs include <strong>two scientific papers</strong>. The first paper aims to provide a set of criteria for identifying good practices based on the findings from the analysis of the recommendations adopted within the UN human rights framework (Treaty Bodies, HRC special procedures) and insights from the review of social science literature. The second paper analyzes qualitative interviews using the grounded theory approach and aims to describe the understanding of good practices by human rights experts as well as verify and adjust the criteria developed earlier in the project.</p>

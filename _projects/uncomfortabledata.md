<p>At least 330,000 children are deprived of their liberty for migration-related reasons every year worldwide. Because of the limited data available publicly, little is known about the characteristics of these children. The project intended to explore the variety of data collection practices and conduct in-depth case studies describing selected data collection frameworks.</p>

<h3>Key highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishment of a learning community</strong> - I assembled a team of five young researchers supported by a creative graphic designer. Our team exemplified diversity (Australia, Brazil, France, Lebanon, Serbia), expertise, and dedication to making a meaningful impact. The workspace was arranged on Slack, allowing us to document and navigate through more than 2,700 messages sent between us.</li>
<li><strong>Utilizing FOI requests for data collection</strong> - to extract the most up-to-date statistics on children in immigration detention, we submitted Freedom of Information requests to 37 states (out of which 23 replied).</li>
<li><strong>Designing the Data Maturity Index</strong> - the dedicated index served as an analytical tool to measure the robustness of domestic data collection frameworks, including their legal framework, public accessibility, timeliness and level of disaggregation. The index scored the countries on a scale of 0-20, providing a basis for selecting promising practices for in-depth case studies (Mexico & Bosnia and Herzegovina).</li>

🚀 Led a vibecoding workshop at <a href="https://www.itu.int">International Telecommunication Union</a> HQ in Geneva, working with human rights professionals from <a href="https://www.ohchr.org">OHCHR</a>, <a href="https://www.impactoss.org">Impact OSS</a>, and <a href="https://huridocs.org">HURIDOCS</a> on AI-human collaboration. The focus: building simple but transformative tools - document analysis dashboards, search engines, filtering systems - that solve real bottlenecks when working with hundreds of PDFs. Not replacing human expertise, but amplifying it. Thank you <a href="https://www.freiheit.org/human-rights-hub">FNF Human Rights Hub</a> for the invitation to share the responsible vibecoding approach with this incredible group.

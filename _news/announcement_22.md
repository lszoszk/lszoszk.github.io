🤖 Leading a team at UAM Faculty of Law and Administration (with Dr Igor B. Nestoruk) in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nask.pl">NASK</a> to fine-tune Polish Large Language Models (PLLuM) for legal and administrative tasks. Our team created specialized datasets that accurately reflect language use in legislation and administrative decisions. The goal: developing AI models capable of precise generation of legal content while maintaining substantive and formal correctness.

🤝 I started my re:constitution fellowship with <a href="https://huridocs.org">HURIDOCS</a>. "Understanding how constitutional and human rights standards apply in the digital age requires hands-on collaboration between researchers and practitioners. The re:constitution fellowship at HURIDOCS gives me exactly that - a space to test ideas where they matter most." I am an Assistant Professor of Law at Adam Mickiewicz University and a former Fulbright Senior Fellow at Columbia University's Neurotechnology Center. I have developed digital tools for human rights research, including a web application for analysing UN Treaty Body General Comments. I joined HURIDOCS in 2026 through the re:constitution fellowship programme, supported by Forum Transregionale Studien and Democracy Reporting International.

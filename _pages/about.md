I am a social scientist with a legal background and a self-trained data scientist.

My research focuses on <strong>international human rights law</strong> and the challenges posed by new technologies, such as <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>neurotechnologies</strong>. Considering how digital technologies erase geographical boundaries, it’s vital to address new challenges from a global perspective. This is why my work concentrates on the UN framework, with a specific focus on social rights and the rights of the child.

I employ a range of methodologies, including natural language processing (Python), statistics, corpus linguistics, and grounded theory.

Currently, I am working on <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/neurorights/">neurorights</a> and develop <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/accesstohrinfo/">open-source search tools for human rights case law</a>, including dashboards for the Polish Constitutional Court and the ECHR, as well as a <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/generalcomments/">UN Treaty Bodies document search</a>.

In 2024-25, I was a Fulbright scholar at the <a href="https://ntc.columbia.edu/">Columbia University (Neurotechnology Center)</a>, focusing on mental privacy and speech decoding.

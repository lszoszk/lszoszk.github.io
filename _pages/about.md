I am a social scientist with legal background and self-trained data scientist.

My research focuses on the international protection of human rights and the challenges posed by new technologies, in particular Artificial Intelligence and neurotechnologies. Digital technologies break down borders and geographical barriers, so it is essential that we address the challenges they bring on a global scale. This is why my work concentrates on the UN framework, with a specific focus on economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as the rights of the child. 

In my legal research, I employ a range of methodologies, including natural language processing, statistical analysis, corpus linguistics, and grounded theory.

Currently, I am working on neurorights, the <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/goodpractices/">concept of 'good practice' in human rights</a>, and developing an advanced <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/generalcomments/">search engine for UN treaty body documents</a>.

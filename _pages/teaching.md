<h2>🎯 Responsible Vibe-Coding: Programming with Natural Language for Human Rights</h2>

Teaching non-programmers to build working applications through AI-assisted coding. After two days, human rights lawyers in Venice built legal document search tools from scratch—with zero prior coding experience.

<h3>Why Human Rights Experts Need NLP & Vibe-Coding</h3>

<p>Human rights work is fundamentally about text: treaties, reports, legal documents, testimonies. Even basic NLP techniques can be gamechangers for human rights work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transform collection of documents into searchable databases</li>
<li>Find patterns invisible to human reading (trends across decades of reports)</li>
<li>Quantify arguments with data (e.g., "Internet access" mentioned 27 times in 2024 reports - <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13642987.2025.2552467">see example</a>)</li>
<li>Build tools like <a href="https://lszoszk.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">General Comments Database</a></li>
<li>Democratize access to legal information</li>
</ul>

<p>Read about promises and pitfalls of NLP and AI in judiciary in the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/a80169-ai-judicial-systems-promises-and-pitfalls-report-special" target="_blank">recent report of the SR on Independence of Judges and Lawyers (A/80/169)</a>.</p>

<h3>Six Lessons from Teaching Vibe-Coding</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>🔓 The AI Exposure Gap is Massive:</strong> Only 6% of participants had used paid LLMs. Most judged AI's capabilities based on free tiers—creating misleading impressions of what AI can do.</li>

<li><strong>🎯 Purpose Must Precede Process:</strong> Top complaint: "I didn't understand WHY we were building this." Start with the problem (why this beats Ctrl+F), not the solution (how to build a search engine).</li>

<li><strong>⚡ The "Seeing It Work" Moment is Critical:</strong> For non-technical learners: working demos before explanations. Abstract concepts mean nothing until they see concrete output.</li>

<li><strong>📊 Bimodal Learning Outcomes:</strong> 38% "got it" immediately, 25% remained lost—little middle ground. AI tools don't reduce learning curves; they change their shape entirely.</li>

<li><strong>🔄 Application Overwhelm > Concept Overwhelm:</strong> Participants weren't confused by programming—they were overwhelmed by tool-switching (Cursor → Colab → Terminal). Friction reduction > technical purity.</li>

<li><strong>💬 "Natural Language" Isn't Natural to Everyone:</strong> Prompting in English ≠ accessible. Programming is structured thinking. Some struggle with computational logic, whether in Python or prompts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Workshop Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Website:</strong> <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/ideas/vibecoding-human-rights">Responsible Vibe-Coding for Human Rights | Venice 2025</a></li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Building real tools (document databases, search engines) in 2 days</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Google Colab, Claude Code, natural language prompting</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Learning through building, not theory</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Teaching AI literacy to human rights professionals isn't about making them programmers—it's about showing what's possible and giving them confidence to try.</em></p>

<h2>⚖️ Human Rights and Technology in the Digital Age – An Interdisciplinary Perspective</h2>

Digital technologies – such as Artificial Intelligence, biometric recognition systems, or credit scoring systems – are gradually entering our daily lives, without us even noticing them. This course aims at providing students with solid knowledge on the impact of these technologies on the protection of human rights. To this end, this course highlights the importance of an ethical, human-centric, and accessible tech-infused future.

The course is divided into two modules, namely: 1) introduction to data science; and 2) international human rights law. The first module allows the students to better understand the concepts of programming, statistical modeling, and algorithms and gain some basic practical skills in these areas. In this context, the students will be provided with an opportunity to experience first-hand the dilemmas and challenges of designing an application (e.g. through running a code on their own). Within the second module, the students will learn about the existing case-law, regulations, and soft law initiatives related to the intersection of international human rights law and digital technologies. Completion of this module improves skills in analyzing legal texts and case law.
